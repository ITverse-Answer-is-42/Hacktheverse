# GeoPulse - Mapping Health, One Breath at a Time.

## Overview
Welcome to GeoPulse, an innovative application that empowers users with valuable insights into air quality and socio-economic factors for cities and countries worldwide. GeoPulse features a versatile front-end, offering both web and mobile applications, powered by a robust back-end system. With GeoPulse, you can easily access air quality data and explore how it relates to socio-economic indicators.

## Features

### Feature 1: Air Quality Metrics
- **Air Quality Index (AQI):** GeoPulse uses a generic color scheme to represent air quality for enhanced user understanding.
- **Top 10 Polluted Cities:** Stay informed about the top 10 most polluted cities globally, sourced from the IQAir API's AQI data. Our dynamic and visually appealing representation includes user-friendly filters and sorting options.
- **Top 10 Cleanest Cities:** Discover the top 10 cleanest cities worldwide based on the latest IQAir API's AQI data. Our feature includes an enhanced user experience with filters and sorting options.
- **Search by City/Country:** GeoPulse features an intuitive search bar with auto-complete functionality, making it easy to access air quality data for specific cities or countries.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Compare air quality data for at least two cities, visualized side by side or overlaying data on a single chart or graph. We use key air quality metrics, such as AQI, PM2.5 levels, PM10 levels, and ozone levels for comparison.

### Feature 2: Socio-Economic Factors
Enhance your engagement with socio-economic data for countries associated with the cities in our air quality data. We provide the following indicators:
- Total GDP
- GDP Per Capita
- GDP Growth
- Total Population
- Population Growth

### Feature 3: Interactive Map Integration
- Visualize air quality and socio-economic data on an interactive map.
- Combining location-based information from the AirQuality API with geographical representations, you can gain valuable insights into air quality and its correlation with socio-economic factors in different regions.
- Key Components:
  - Map API Integration: We have integrated [Google map](https://developers.google.com/maps) as our map API of choice.
  - Geospatial Data Overlay: Overlay air quality data onto the map, providing real-time markers or visual indicators on specific locations based on the air quality API. Different colors or icons represent air quality levels, allowing users to quickly grasp the information.
  - Socio-Economic Data Filters: Our user-friendly filters allow you to customise your map view, focusing on specific socio-economic indicators or air quality metrics. You can filter by GDP per capita, view only cities with particular air quality ranges, or explore population growth in a certain region.

## Backend
- Our back-end system applies data processing and transformation techniques to combine air quality data with socio-economic indicators.
- We ensure data consistency and accuracy through rigorous validation and quality checks.
- We provide well-documented API endpoints that the frontend (web or mobile) can use to request data, ensuring readiness to handle user queries.

## Frontend
We've designed an engaging and user-friendly interface suitable for the Android platform.
